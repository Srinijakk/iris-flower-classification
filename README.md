IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

OVERVIEW

Welcome to the Iris Classification project! In this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into their respective species based on their features. By harnessing the power of Python programming language along with scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries, we'll explore various machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal.

OBJECTIVE

The primary objective of this project is to build a classification model that can effectively differentiate between three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This model will be trained on a dataset containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each iris sample.

METHODLOGY:

1.Data Exploration and Preprocessing: We'll begin by exploring the Iris dataset, checking for any missing values or outliers, and preprocessing the data to ensure its suitability for training machine learning models.

2.Model Selection and Training: We'll experiment with a variety of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, and neural networks implemented using TensorFlow. Each model will be trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated to determine its performance.

3.Model Evaluation: The trained models will be evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation will help us identify the most effective model for classifying iris flowers.

4.Model Deployment: Once a suitable model is identified, it will be deployed to classify new iris samples into their respective species based on their features.
